- 👋 Hi, I’m @Littleamish2
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, back end development, and computers in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ through ODU's CS150 course and the basics of what makes up a computer through _Building a Modern Computer From First Principles_
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on where to go from where I am currently. What to learn, what resources are available, etc.
